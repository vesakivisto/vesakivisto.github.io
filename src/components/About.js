          <p>I'm Vesa Kivist√∂, an aspiring developer ready to conquer the world. I'm interested mostly in web development, though lately I have gained interest in mobile development
            as well. I have experience in full-stack development and I'm always looking forward to learning something new.</p>
          <p>I've always been interested in information and communications technology as well as programming, which led to me starting to study software development at
            Saimaa Vocational College Sampo. After graduation from Sampo with a Bachelor's Degree and a Matriculation Examination Certificate, I started my studies in
            software engineering at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, from which I graduated in December 2017. I plan on applying for a Master's Degree in either
            artificial intelligence or machine learning in a couple years, though I'm also interested in bionics and robotics so who really knows what I end up studying.</p>
          <p>I spend my spare time usually by playing video games and listening to music. I also enjoy photographing, though the progression with photographing has been
            a slow one. Other than that, I also enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi books and taking walks to clear my mind.</p>
